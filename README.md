# digital-dice-solutions
This repository contains solutions to the problems presented by Professor Paul J. Nahin in his book Digital Dice. While many of these problems can be solved analytically, I have approached them using computer simulations.  The repository is currently a work in progress and subject to ongoing updates and improvements.
